        <p>From June 2023-June 2024, I supported the University of Pennsylvania Libraries Community Engagement (PLCE) Department in its efforts to collaborate with local West Philadelphia elementary schools to operate their libraries. With the exception of about seven schools, the rest of Philadelphia public schools do not have professional librarians on staff and thus, they depend on support from volunteers. PLCE works in partnership with the non-profit organization, West Philadelphia Alliance for Children (WePAC), to purchase books and recruit volunteer staff for nearby elementary school libraries. I am the sole technical services librarian in the department, which empowers me to lead the classification and descriptive cataloging efforts for each participating school. Along with supporting back-end projects, I contributed to and presented the following training resource for WePAC volunteers.</p>

        <h4 class="contentSectionSubtitle">Rebuilding Furness High School's Library: 2023-2024 Academic Year</h4>
        <p>The following photographs document my work with PLCE to update and reopen the library at Furness High School in South Philadelphia. According to Furness principal and former alum, Daniel Peou, the high school has not been managed by a state-certified librarian in 30 years. Based on our initial observation in November, Furness' library desperately needs an infusion of new literature books and reference materials on its shelves. The five photographs at the end of the gallery feature the books that were purchased using funds from a Philly Community Engagement ALliance (Philly CEAL) grant. Philly CEAL is a branch of the National Institutes of Health's CEAL initiative for the entire United States. As the PLCE library intern, I'm responsible for identifying accurate and complete MARC21 records for each Philly CEAL grant book; updating Furness's catalog data with the relevant metadata records; and cataloging each material with a library barcode and a Dewey Decimal Classification spine label.</p>

        <h4 class="contentSectionSubtitle">Popular subject headings - Furness HS</h4>
        <p> Gina and Rosie previously collected book genre requests from students and other members of the Furness community. Using funds from a generous donor, they order the books and we (myself, PLCE staff, and Penn work study students) catalog them all by hand. Topics such as graphic novels, dating, high school situations, Black American culture, immigrant experiences and sex education are so popular since they're most relevant to teenage readers</p>

    <section id="pl-IPC">
        <h2 class="contentSectionTitle">Information Processing Center</h2>
        <p>In Fall 2023, I began my second internship placement at Penn Libraries in the IPC, where librarians with metadata and cataloging expertise import, edit, or create original records for items in the library catalog. I've been tasked with performing retroactive conversions on catalog records that are missing subject headings. Essentially, when libraries began to transition their card catalog holdings into databases, they contracted services from companies that specialized in converting metadata from the physical cards to digital records. However, if the original card catalogs lacked certain metadata, libraries would receive digital records that the companies completed with the limited information that they had. The problem with incomplete metadata records is that they hinder the discoverability and accessibility of materials that could be of interest to researchers and patrons. Adding missing subject headings to incomplete catalog records will guarantee that patrons interested in that particular subject will find the materials for which they're looking.</p>
