            <p>I’m a mid-career changer who is transitioning into technical services librarianship. I’m currently enrolled in Drexel University’s MLIS program and will be graduating in June 2024. While completing my degree part-time, I’ve interned with Penn Libraries; the International Center for MultiGenerational Legacies of Trauma (ICMGLT); and the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.</p>

            <p>Thanks to my graduate courses and internship placements, I quickly discovered that working with data and metadata brings me as much joy as teaching social studies or engaging in visual arts. Though I initially felt overwhelmed when I enrolled in “techie” courses like <em>Foundations of Data and Information</em> or <em>Python Programming Foundations</em>, I ended the term with a level of confidence that I had never experienced before. Today, I’m utilizing my resource description knowledge to catalog hundreds of books for the Penn Libraries Community Engagement team. I’m also training with a senior information processing librarian to complete technical services projects, such as the retrospective conversion of bibliographic records and engagement with linked data through BIBFRAME and Sinopia.</p>
            
            <p>A native of Philadelphia and a product of the local public school system, I’m invested in advocating for the best educational opportunities for all Philadelphians. In addition to my professional interests, I’m an avid solo traveler, a visual arts hobbyist, and the emotional support person to two, very energetic, senior cats. I previously earned a BA in International Relations from Boston University and a MS in Educational Studies from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
